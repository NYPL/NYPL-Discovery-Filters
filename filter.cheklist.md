# Discovery  Search Results Filtering Checklist

## Problem Statement
**_What Problem are we solving?_**
    
Shared Collection Interface requires the ability to filter search results. Presently there is no way for users to filter their results against any criterion.

## Strategic Goals
**_Goal: More People Reading More_**

Outcome: Researchers researching more. Researchers having greater control over their search queries and achieving their goal of finding exactly what they need faster. Doing better research across the shared collections.
